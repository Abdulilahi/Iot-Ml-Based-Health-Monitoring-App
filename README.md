# Iot-Ml-Based-Health-Monitoring-App
This project introduces a real-time health monitoring and diagnostic system that synergizes IoT, machine learning, and generative AI to deliver intelligent, accessible healthcare solutions. At its core is the ESP32 microcontroller, connected to vital sensors like the MAX30100 (for heart rate and SpOâ‚‚) and a temperature sensor, enabling the continuous collection of health data. This data is broadcasted over a local network via an onboard web server. A lightweight Streamlit web application periodically fetches the sensor data, feeds it to a trained Random Forest Classifier, and determines the user's health status as Healthy or Unhealthy. The system further utilizes Google's Generative AI (Gemini API) to automatically generate a personalized health report with prescription-like insights, which can be downloaded as a text file. This integrated, AI-powered diagnostic platform enhances remote monitor
